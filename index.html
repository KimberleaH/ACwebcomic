    <meta name="description" content="Ancient Chronicles is a sci fi fantasy webcomic 
      epic. It is truly a tale that will never end. The story is heavily molded by 
      personal experience, the voices of many, and way too many nights spent 
      researching weird things. Readers step into a beautifully imperfect world marred 
      by corruption and discourse.">

            <h4>Phase 1 Complete</h4>
            <p>We've broken tasks to finish the first chapter into phases. Phase 1 is finished! We've colored in all
              the pages that have already been inked. Now we're moving on to inking and coloring the remaining pages. 
              From there we'll start the third and final phase of finishing all the pages.

            <h4>New Year</h4>
            <p>Happy new year! Progress on Chapter 1 has been steady. And our discord community is slowly growing!
              With luck, the story will return from hiatus tentatively this fall or winter and we can move forward with
              Chapter 2. More exciting stuff will come with the completion of both chapters.

              The website itself is a work in progress. Whispy oversees its development and it's getting closer and closer
              to how we'd like it to be. The focus now is integrating more accessibility features. It's slow going since
              there is plenty of learning involved. If you'd like to stay up-to-date with our progress and hang out with 
              some beautiful people, come join our Discord community!

            <h4>Making Progress</h4>
            <p>Hi folks! We're gradually making headway on our efforts to return from hiatus. Chapter 1 itself is about 80%
              fully inked so here's the plan thus far:
              <br>(1) finish updating the cast's color references
              <br>(2) color the 80% of pages that are ready for color
              <br>(3) finish inking and coloring the last 20%
              <br>And once Chapter 1 is finished, we'll announce a return date, whenever that'll be. We're just two nerds
              working on this project in our spare time, so we appreciate your patience and support. If you'd like to support
              us more directly, we are currently accepting donations. Come join us on Discord and spread the word about our story!
            </p>

              <p>Nothing could be more faithful, iconic, or unnecessarily versatile as a kartuu. After all, "kartuu is best." 
                But do take heed... Despite their loving nature, they aren't to be trifled with. And the most important rule 
                of all: never run from a kartuu.</p>
