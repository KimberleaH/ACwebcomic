            <p>It has been two months now. I've been learning at my own pace. This whole
              pandemic thing has been giving me lots of time to myself to practice and
              dabble. I feel really confident in my abilities and I really enjoy hand coding.
              I'm pleased to say that I figured out how to connect VSC and github so now I
              can push all my updates through git which I have messed with a little. I'm
              pretty versed in css and html, but there is still so much to learn and practice.
              I'm extremely happy to announce that the AC website is more or less complete.
              The archives work, viewers can now read the comic directly on the website and
              I've made various tweaks to the site over the past couple months to get it
              closer to how I like it. The challenges that came with coding this site were
              very fun to tackle. Even though my brain gets exhausted from learning code --
              Javascript is <i>especially</i> difficult for my mind to wrap around -- I think
              it's really fun and keeps my mind busy.</p>
            <p>As a 3D artist, I enjoy it when the software crashes (after I save
              of course) or I manage to crash it on purpose, so breaking websites and fixing
              the problem is pretty fun. It's fun to learn how everything works and figure
              out why one line of code destroys the whole thing. One of my toughest challenges
              was to find out why there was white space surrounding the website when viewed in
              landscape mode on iOS mobile devices. And after hours of trying different media
              queries and so on, it turned out that I needed to set a rule in css for the html
              tag that turned the document background the color I wanted and for good measure I
              made the width 100%. Problem solved. So simple!</p>
            <p>I've learned a lot more about CSS like how to make grid layouts, use flexbox,
              make responsive designs, and so on. I'm learning PHP very slowly and I plan to
              learn more. I'm very excited to get the website properly hosted and make it official.</p>
              <br>

            <p>For the past month, I've been learning to code through Codecademy and I've
              been learning really fast. I've always wanted to know how to code a website.
              I remember growing up being on this thing called Proboards and my friend and
              I would make these funny looking little fan websites with different sections
              to visit. Then in 2010 I joined DeviantART which, until this year with their
              recent layout update, allowed a user to apply html and css to their gallery
              page, front wall, and journal skins. So I got to playing with that. I got to
              learn a some basic html through that like how to bold, italicize, underline,
              and strikethrough text with b, i, u, and s, respectively. Plus &lt;small&gt;,
              header tags, a href, and &lt;hr&gt; which is one of my favorite things.</p>
            <p>I tried to <i>make</i> a website for AC plenty of times before. Wix, Weebly,
              Wordpress, even messed with Adobe Muse, etc. None of them did it for me.
              Especially since I had no clue how to code, wasn't really sure what I was
              doing, not at all pleased with the options available to me. I was fully
              prepared to pay a freelancer to do what I was after, but I asked a favorite
              webcomic artist how she came upon her website and she said she coded it herself.
              I'd been trying desperately to find a way to get a website to work out with
              Wordpress plugins like Comic Easle and Webcomic, even researched webcomic
              specific CMS options. I was <i>never</i> happy with the results or struggled to
              even get anything to work.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm a concept artist who specializes in organic subjects. I've not been
              all that technically inclined. I always enjoyed messing with html and tweaking
              snippets of css on DeviantART. I'd been trying very hard to get a job in the
              creative/game dev industry. It hasn't been all that fruitful yet. So I thought
              about another path that I could try out and I looked to web development. My goal
              was to be able to code a website for Ancient Chronicles and within my first
              month of learning, here I have the bare minimum of what I'm after. It links to
              where the comic is hosted on Tapastic at least, but I'd like to host the comic
              on the website itself. So that's what I plan to do next. I figured that coding
              my own website would give me the flexibility to make it look <i>exactly</i> how
              I wanted it. Of course I started with a photoshop mock up and went from there.
              We'll see how the rest goes as I continue to learn.</p>
