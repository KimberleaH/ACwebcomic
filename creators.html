          they work together seamlessly to continue the creation of the universe.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">...One Massive Story</h2>
        <p class="break"><i>Legend has it that the universe was created by powerful beings known as Ancients. 
          It's said that a dark evil had risen, but the Ancients sacrificed themselves to save what they had created.
          However, when the taint began to spread and horrific monsters began to emerge, everything everyone
          had ever known ceased to be. And now with a great darkness threatening to plunge the universe into
          ruinous chaos, any hope of restoring the peace has begun to fade ever farther away.</i></p>

        <p>Ancient Chronicles is a sci fi fantasy webcomic epic about a progressive universe falling into chaos. 
          The story is heavily molded by personal experience, the voices of many, and way too many nights spent 
          researching weird things. Readers step into a beautifully imperfect world marred by corruption and 
          discourse. Ancient Chronicles holds a heavy focus on world building, lore, inclusivity, and the perfect 
          balance of science fiction and fantasy.</p>
