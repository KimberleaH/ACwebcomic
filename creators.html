        <h1>The Creators</h1>
        <p class="strong">In the beginning, there was nothingness: born of chaos, ever swirling, and order, calmly flowing. 
          Together, the creators offer stability. Eternally, they maintain the balance of the universe.</strong></p>
        <p>Kimberlea and Samuel live in Kansas and met in early grade school. The two love stories in all their forms. 
          They have both dedicated the last seventeen years to the story that matters the most: Ancient Chronicles.</p>

        <p>Throughout its development, characters and ideas evolved or were dropped altogether. Ancient Chronicles 
          has seen many, many overhauls over the years, some of which were the result of a seemingly insignificant 
          change. For much of its lifetime, Ancient Chronicles was originally intended to be a written series of 
          novels. It wasn't until around 2016 that we decided to pursue a graphic novel format. This would make it 
          easier to showcase our characters and the universe they live in. The greatest and most recent overhaul 
          happened in 2018. This one was done over a series of 9 hour phone calls (literally) after Kimberlea had 
          moved out of state. We finalized the foundational world building, solidified the roadmap of the main 
          story-line, fleshed out the plot of the first book, and wrote the scripts of the first few chapters.</p>

        <p>Production of book one's first chapter started in 2018 as well. But hiatus began the next year after 
          mental health decline and other stressors took their toll. Compounded by the pandemic, moving, and 
          stressful day-jobs, comic progress didn't start back up in earnest until 2021. Progress was slow, but 
          chapter one inched ever closer to completion.</p>

        <p>With our first chapter finally finished and a new website to showcase all our years of effort, we've 
          never been more proud. The story will continue with no signs of stopping. Ancient Chronicles' planned 
          books, in no particular order: Soulstones, Muun Rivaa, Crossing Paths, Prehistory (working title), and 
          one or two other determined books. Beyond that, we have a growing list of side stories like Through the 
          Storm and The Bat and the Bird, to name a couple.</p>

        <p>As of this writing, we have plans to launch our first ever crowdfunding campaign to print the first 
          three chapters of Soulstones.</p>
