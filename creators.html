      <section id="about_AC" class="content">
        <h1 class="heading">...One Massive Story</h1>
        <p><i>Legend has it that the universe was created by powerful beings known as Ancients. It's said
          that a dark evil had risen, but the Ancients sacrificed themselves to save what they had created.
          However, when the taint began to spread and horrific monsters began to emerge, everything everyone
          had ever known ceased to be. And now with a great darkness threatening to plunge the universe into
          ruinous chaos, any hope of restoring the peace has begun to fade ever farther away.</i></p>
        <p>Ancient Chronicles is a sci fi fantasy webcomic epic. It is truly a tale that
          will never end. The story is heavily molded by personal experience, the voices of many, and
          way too many nights spent researching weird things. Readers step into a beautifully imperfect world
          marred by corruption and discourse.</p>
        <p>What makes AC so unique is its heavy focus on worldbuilding and lore, its inclusivity,
          and how it knits together a perfect balance of both science fiction and fantasy. AC's
          characters are highly relatable, dynamic, and most certainly memorable. Much of what
          exists in the world of Ancient Chronicles has been forged by the happenings of reality...</p>
        <p>...with a twist of the imagination.</p>
