      <p id="both">Both grew up in Kansas and met in 2007, shortly before the conception of the first inklings
        of what would later come to be known as Ancient Chronicles. Both compliment each other's
        developmental styles, and they work together seamlessly to continue the creation of the universe.</p>

      <!-- General About -->
      <section id="about_AC">
        <h1>...One Massive Story</h1>
        <p>Ancient Chronicles is a science fiction and fantasy webcomic epic. It is truly a tale that
          will never end. The story is heavily molded by personal experience, the voices of many, and
          way too many nights spent surfing the web. Readers step into a beautifully imperfect world
          marred by corruption and discourse.</p>
        <p>What makes AC so unique is its heavy focus on worldbuilding and lore, its inclusitivity,
          and how it knits together a perfect balance of both science fiction and fantasy. AC's
          characters are highly relatable, personable, and most certainly memorable. Much of what
          exists in the world of Ancient Chronicles has been forged by the happenings of reality...</p>
        <p>...with a twist of the imagination.</p>
