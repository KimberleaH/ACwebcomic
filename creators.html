      <h1 id="heading">Two Creators...</h1>

      <p>Both grew up in Kansas and met in 2007,
        shortly before the conception of the first inklings of what would later come to be known as Ancient
        Chronicles. Both compliment each other's developmental styles, and they work together seamlessly to
        continue the creation of the universe.</p>

      <!-- General About -->
      <section id="about_AC">
        <h1>...One Massive Story</h1>
        <p>Ancient Chronicles is a science fiction and fantasy webcomic <em>epic.</em> It is truly
           a tale that will never end. The story is heavily molded by personal experience, the voices
           of many, and way too many nights spent surfing the web. Readers step into a beautifully
           imperfect world marred by corruption and discourse.</p>
        <p>What makes AC so unique is its heavy focus on worldbuilding and lore, and how it knits
           together a perfect balance of both science fiction and fantasy. AC's characters are
           highly relatable, personable, and most certainly memorable. Much of what exists in
           the world of Ancient Chronicles has been forged by the happenings of reality...</p>
           <p>...with a twist of the imagination.</p>
